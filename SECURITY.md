## Reporting a Vulnerability

There are not usually vulnerabilities in Moonrise. While GitHub may report security issues, they are often in the dependencies used to build your website.

Once your final site is generated and live on GitHub Pages, there is generally nothing much to hack. You are only serving -- essentially -- glorified text files to visitors of your Moonrise site.

Moonrise was made for running even without servers.
